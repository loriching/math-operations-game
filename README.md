## Math Game (currently unnamed)

#### Game description and basic rules (minimum viable product)
1. The player is given a set of numbers on the left side of an equation and one number on the right side.
2. The player must select operations to place between the numbers on the left side such that the left side equals the right side.
3. If the player can successfully match both sides of the equation in value, the player earns a point.
4. This project could be implemented in the terminal with typed user input.

#### Options for further expansion
- Multiple levels: the number of possible operations is 2, 4, or 6.
- Numbers can be only integers, or they can be any rational number.
- The player can turn PEMDAS on or off.
- Use Pygame to design a more interactive and visually appealing game.
- Experiment with implementing the front-end with other frameworks such as React.

Built with: Python (current), Pygame (optional; haven't learned this yet)
